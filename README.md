This is project of a calculator

In this project I practiced a little bit of HTML, CSS. Much more JavaScript, the hardest part of the project was obviously logic.

This project took me some time mainly because after writing major part I abandoned it for a couple of weeks to focus on something else code related and to give myself some time to forget how I wrote this and come back to lets say alien project, then I fought successfully with my spaghetti code until it was finished.

The project was pretty challenging as I was coding mainly by myself not following any tutorial

To anyone who's reading this I wish you good day :)
